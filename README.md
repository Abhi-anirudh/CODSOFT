# Movie Genre Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The model uses techniques like TF-IDF for text vectorization and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for genre prediction.
